### **Introduction** 

When writing a research proposal, the first thing is to choose a research topic. Therefore, it is important to systematically investigate the development of research topics and understand how the research field has been evolving. In this analysis, the evolution of research topics related to traumatic brain injury was investigated using an natural language processing approach so that academic researchers can better understand the historical and current situation of this field.

### **Methods**

#### Data acquisition

The data was queried on PubMed using a python toolkit "pymed". The querying keywords include "traumatic brain injury, brain biomechanics, and concussion" with time period limited from1991 to 2021. The contents downloaded included article title, abstract, authors, publication year, and journal title.  

#### Data cleaning

First, article titles and abstracts were combined to maximize the information included in the text. Next, punctuations were removed and all nouns and adjectives were extracted from all the texts.  

#### Exploratory analysis

The number of publications and top 10 journals with most publications from 1991 to 2021 were queried using Pandas.
